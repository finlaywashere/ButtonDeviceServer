# ButtonDeviceServer - A server to listen for button press events over the internet

This server is designed to handle taking input from buttons connected to ESP-01s and use it for something useful.

This program was part of a 2020 Christmas present (https://github.com/finlaywashere/ButtonDeviceClient)
